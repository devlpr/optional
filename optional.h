/**
 * A C++ optional container that supports iteration and has emplace
 * semantics to avoid copies.
 *
 * It uses variadic templates to forward all args by reference to the
 * instantiable type T.  Again, this is to elide copies and is the emplace
 * semantic.
 *
 * This loosely follows the Scala Option class API.  Necessity being the father of
 * invention, this spawned from the missing features in the C++ language, namely
 * Optional.
 *
 * Having used Scala's Option class, going back to C++ and having to check
 * unique or shared pointers to verify whether or not they are set seems very
 * primitive.  It can also lead to some bad situations if it isn't checked,
 * which is the real reason for this class.
 *
 * The beautiful thing about Optional and Scala optionals is that they support
 * iteration, which either iterates zero or one time, depending on whether it is
 * defined.  This leads to very easy to reason about code with minimal if
 * statements and clear meaning.  It is meant to help stop the spread of null
 * values around a code-base.
